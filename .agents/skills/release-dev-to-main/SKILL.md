# Skill: Releasing `dev` → `main`

Use this skill whenever you are asked to merge `dev` into `main`. This is a **release event** — not a regular feature PR. The title, description, and changelog must reflect the full scope of changes being promoted to production.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> CI enforces that `main` can **only** be updated via a PR from `dev`. Never merge any other branch directly into `main`.

---

## 1. Pre-Flight Checklist

Before opening the PR, verify all of the following:

- [ ] Both test suites pass locally on `dev`:
  ```bash
  # Backend (from backend/)
  python manage.py test

  # Frontend (from frontend/)
  npm run test
  ```
- [ ] `dev` is fully up-to-date with `origin/dev` (no unpushed commits):
  ```bash
  git fetch origin
  git status
  ```
- [ ] The `dev` branch has been pushed to `origin`:
  ```bash
  git push origin dev
  ```

---

## 2. Generate the Changelog

Run the following command to list every commit on `dev` that is not yet on `main`:

```bash
git log main..dev --oneline
```

Then group the output by Conventional Commit type. Use this mapping:

| Prefix | Changelog Section |
|---|---|
| `feat` | ✨ New Features |
| `fix` | 🐛 Bug Fixes |
| `refactor` | ♻️ Refactors |
| `perf` | ⚡ Performance |
| `build` / `build(deps)` | 📦 Dependency Updates |
| `docs` | 📝 Documentation |
| `test` | 🧪 Tests |
| `ci` | ⚙️ CI / Tooling |
| `chore` | 🔧 Chores |

- Omit merge commits (lines starting with `Merge pull request`).
- Omit bot-generated Dependabot bumps from the main changelog body — group them together under **Dependency Updates** as a single collapsed block.
- List items as bullet points using the commit subject (strip the type prefix).

## 3. PR Title Format

Use the following format for the PR title:

```
release: <short summary of the release> (YYYY-MM-DD)
```

The summary should be a **2–5 word description** of the dominant theme of this release — what most of the changes are about.

**Examples:**
```
release: evaluation engine and analytics (2026-07-02)
release: member dashboard and portfolio (2026-06-15)
release: dependency updates and CI improvements (2026-07-01)
```

---

## 4. PR Description Structure

Use this exact structure for the PR body. Fill in every section — do not leave placeholder text.

```markdown
## 🚀 Release — <short summary> (<YYYY-MM-DD>)

> Promotes `dev` → `main`. All changes listed below are now being deployed to production.

---

## ✨ New Features
- <feat commit subject>
- <feat commit subject>

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
- <fix commit subject>
- <fix commit subject>

## ♻️ Refactors

## 📝 Documentation

## ⚙️ CI / Tooling

<details>
<summary>📦 Dependency Updates (<N> bumps)</summary>

</details>

## ✅ Pre-Release Verification

- [ ] `python manage.py test` — all backend tests pass
- [ ] `npm run test` — all frontend tests pass
- [ ] No regressions observed on the dev environment

## Type of change

- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)
- [ ] Refactor (changes that do not add functionality or fix a bug)
- [ ] This change requires a documentation update
```

## 5. Omit Sections That Don't Apply

If there are no commits for a particular section (e.g., no `perf` commits), **omit that section entirely** from the PR body. Do not leave empty sections.
